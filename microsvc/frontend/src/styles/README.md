# Styles

This directory contains additional CSS files and style utilities.

## Structure

- `globals.css` - Global styles (already exists in app/ directory)
- `components.css` - Component-specific styles
- `utilities.css` - Utility classes

Note: This project uses Tailwind CSS for styling. Additional CSS files should be used sparingly and only when Tailwind classes are insufficient.
